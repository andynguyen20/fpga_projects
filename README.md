## FPGA Projects

These are my FPGA projects using the Xilinx XC7Z007S Zynq SoC, where I learn to use Vivado and implement digital designs on the FPGA fabric.

## Project 1
* [**Project 1**](https://github.com/andynguyen20/fpga_projects/tree/main/project_1)
  * Navigating Vivado design and contraint files and getting familiar with connecting to FPGA 
* [**Project 1a**](https://github.com/andynguyen20/fpga_projects/tree/main/project_1a)
  * Creating Verilog and constraint files to map to FPGA using a switch and an LED
* [**Project 1b**](https://github.com/andynguyen20/fpga_projects/tree/main/project_1b)
  * Creating Verilog and constraint files to map to FPGA using all switches and LEDs above it
* [**Project 1c**](https://github.com/andynguyen20/fpga_projects/tree/main/project_1c)
  * Reversing order of switches to LED from project 1b
* [**Project 1d**](https://github.com/andynguyen20/fpga_projects/tree/main/project_1d)
  * Illuminating seven-segment display using buttons for anode display and switches for segments of sseg
* [**Project 1e**](https://github.com/andynguyen20/fpga_projects/tree/main/project_1e)
  * Driving an RGB LED using pushbuttons
* [**Project 1f**](https://github.com/andynguyen20/fpga_projects/tree/main/project_1f)
  * Driving an RGB LED using pushbuttons and a "Master ON/OFF" switch
